Number Guessing Game
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This simple Python script challenges you to guess a randomly generated number within a given range.
The game allows you to set the number of attempts and provides feedback on each guess to help you find the correct number.

Features
Randomly generates a number between 1 and 10.
Allows you to specify the number of attempts (between 1 and 10).
Provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high or too low.
Allows you to quit the game at any time by entering 'q' or 'quit'.
Prompts you to play again after the game ends.

How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Copy the script into a file named guess.py.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing guess.py.
Run the script using the command:
python guess.py
Follow the prompts to play the game.

Usage
The script will ask you how many attempts you would like to have. Enter a positive number up to 10.
You will then be prompted to guess a number between 1 and 10.
If your guess is correct, you win the game and the number of your choices is displayed.
If your guess is incorrect, you will be informed if the guessed number is too high or too low and the number of remaining attempts will be shown.
You can quit the game at any time by typing 'q' or 'quit'.
After the game ends, you will be asked if you want to play again.

Example
When you run the script, you might see interactions like this:

How many attempts would you like to have? 5
Could you enter an integer to guess my number?
You should choose a number between 1 and 10 (or q or quit to quit): 7
Your choice is fewer than the number.
You have 4 attempts left.
...
Do you want to play again? (Yes or No): No
Thanks for playing! Goodbye!
